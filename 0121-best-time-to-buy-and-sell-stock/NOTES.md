Reason for profit_list=[0] => if 'min_price' is getting updated after every loop(i.e the prices list is sorted in decending order, then no profit is possible, in that case 0 has to be returned. And if there is no profit, no element will get appended to 'profit_list'. So, if there is a default zero in 'profit_list', finally when max() is called it will return 0
